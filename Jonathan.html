 <p>He shared with the Global News website what he had experienced, the memories he had with his friends on the battlefield. These are happy memories mixed with grief</p>
<p>After that war, he was back home, having a normal life but what he wanted was to become a soldier. 
Because after that war everything went messy, chaotic, and he does not know how to solve with these problems.</p>
