<h1>WAR </h1>
<div id="introduction">
<h2>SACRIFICE</h2>
<p> - One of the highest manifestations of unresolved conflict, is participation of force of two or more.
Like  every other war, it is a painful war that has fragged back centuries of human history.  
In that war, -	the blood of tens of millions of good people poured in for a handful of blood-thirsty political activists. 
-After the tragic war, people have felt the cruelty, they know, they understand and will never make it repeat again and everyone knows to love and help each other.</p>
